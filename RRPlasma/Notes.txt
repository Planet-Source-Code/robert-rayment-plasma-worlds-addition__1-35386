Plasma Worlds by Robert Rayment  June 2002

As there are two progs I've put the palette files in a parallel
folder (/Pals).  This means that they are picked up by backtracking
from the app. folder so do not change the folder layout unless you
also change the code to pick up the pal files.

The 3D-shapes wrap faster when starting with a smaller picture.  
Landscape resizes the picture to the maximum size (WxH=512x384)
so after this the 3D shape wrapping will be a bit slow.  If you
want landscape to pick up a scrolled or color-cycled picture make
sure the picture is at the maximum size first.

Tunnel smoothing is different in that it smooths the palette directly.
This can always be recovered by clicking the pal file in the list box
and pressing GO.

Only the file named "Plasma.bmp" can be saved to the app. folder.
Plasma, 3D shapes & landscape pictures can all be saved.  If you
want choices then put in a CommonDialog on the Save picture button.

In the ASM prog I've left in some redundant VB Subs
Sub FillSmallArray (core transform to 3D) & Sub FloorCASTER
(landscape projection) for reference.  The core plasma routine
is in the VB version.

The assembler methods can be found in PSC prog
'NASM Editor, assembler & Tutorial'.

The progs 'Tunnels & things', 'VTrack' and 'Spheroid
Wrapping' explain some of the techniques.

If you want to design your own palettes then you can use
the prog 'Palette Design' on PSC but there are others.

Good luck
