Plasma Worlds (Additions) by Robert Rayment.  (Cylindrical tunnel & rotation added to ASM version) Two progs. One, pure VB (no APIs or OCXs) for making plasma screens that can be saved as a bmp, bit slow but adequate when compiled.  Plasma uses a non-recursive routine on to any rectangle and can be wrapped for tiling.  Graininess, scale & color palettes can be changed.  The other prog is the same PLUS scrolling in 16 directions, color cycling, cylindrical, spherical & hyperbolic wrapping and fantasy landscape projections all with multiple controls - VB+APIs+ASM, much faster.  Only tested on Win98, should be OK on ME & XP but some Win2K OSs have problems with this use of Assembler.  Please let me know your OS if you find bugs. Zip 79KB.
