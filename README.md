### Description

Plasma Worlds by Robert Rayment. (Cylindrical tunnel added to ASM version)Two progs. One, pure VB (no APIs or OCXs) for making plasma screens that can be saved as a bmp, bit slow but adequate when compiled. Plasma uses a non-recursive routine on to any rectangle and can be wrapped for tiling. Graininess, scale & color palettes can be changed. The other prog is the same PLUS scrolling in 16 directions, color cycling, cylindrical, spherical & hyperbolic wrapping and fantasy landscape projections all with multiple controls - VB+APIs+ASM, much faster. Only tested on Win98, should be OK on ME & XP but some Win2K OSs have problems with this use of Assembler. Please let me know your OS if you find bugs. Zip 79KB.
